         alt="Juan E. Gilbert" 
         class="hero-image">
    <p>
        Dr. <strong>Juan E. Gilbert</strong> is an influential American computer scientist, researcher, inventor, 
        and educator known for his work in <em>human‑centered computing</em> and expanding access to technology. 
        He is the Andrew Banks Family Preeminence Endowed Professor and Chair of the Computer & Information 
        Science & Engineering Department at the <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">University of Florida</a>, 
        where he leads research in secure and accessible systems, advanced learning technologies, and 
        human‑centered artificial intelligence. His invention <strong>Prime III</strong> — an open‑source voting 
        system designed to be accessible to all voters — has been used in elections to improve usability and inclusion, 
        a rare intersection of computing and real‑world impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond technical innovation, Dr. Gilbert is celebrated for increasing diversity in computing, receiving the 
        Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring from President Obama, 
        and being named a laureate of the <strong>National Medal of Technology and Innovation</strong>. I chose him 
        because his work demonstrates how computer science and software design can solve societal problems and 
        improve accessibility, inspiring my own goals in web programming and ethical tech development.

    <h2>Personal Development</h2>
    <p>
        From Chapters 4–7 of <em>Twelve Pillars</em> by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener, I learned that personal growth requires discipline, focus, and intentional action. Daily effort and good habits are key to mastering skills and achieving goals.
    </p>

    <p>
        Goal setting is essential: breaking long-term objectives into actionable steps helps me stay on track in completing college, building projects, and learning AI and web development. Consistency and reflection turn small daily wins into bigger accomplishments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Learning from mentors, collaborating with peers, and engaging with the tech community accelerates growth. I follow experts like Juan E. Gilbert, participate in online communities, and contribute to open-source projects to apply my skills and make a global impact.
    </p>

    <p>
        These lessons guide me to be disciplined, curious, and proactive—qualities that will help me succeed as a future software engineer and contribute innovative solutions to the global technology community.

    <h2>Favourite AI Idea</h2>
    <p>
        I am fascinated by the concept of an <strong>AI personal learning assistant</strong>, 
        which could revolutionize education by providing personalized tutoring tailored 
        to each student’s pace and style. Such a system could help students grasp concepts 
        faster and more efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
        While this idea has immense potential, there are ethical considerations, 
        including privacy concerns and the risk of over-reliance on AI. These challenges 
        can be addressed through strong data protection policies and careful implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Example of AI tools I admire and have explored:
